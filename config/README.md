# The `config` folder

Home to *many* ugly files.

The files:

- `application.rb` - you shouldn't need to edit this. As it says in the file, the ones in `environments/` take priority

- `database.yml` - stores database credentials

- `deploy.rb` - relates to internal Capistrano deployments

- `puma.rb` - relates to the puma server's settings

- `routes.rb` contains all the routes for the application
